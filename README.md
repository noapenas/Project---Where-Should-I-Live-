# Project---Where-Should-I-Live-
A Data Science project focused on analyzing and comparing various European cities to help determine the best places to live based on economic, demographic, and environmental factors.

Overview:
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing information about multiple cities across Europe. It covers everything from data cleaning and wrangling to advanced visualizations, including interactive maps and predictive insights.

Dataset:
The analysis is based on city_data.csv, which includes metrics such as:
- Economic: GDP per Capita, Average Monthly Salary, Average Rent Price, and Cost of Living.
- Demographic: Population Density, Working Age Population, and Unemployment Rate.
- Environmental/Health: Days of very strong heat stress.
- Social: Main spoken languages.

Tech Stack:
Language: Python

Libraries:
- pandas & numpy (Data Manipulation)
- matplotlib & seaborn (Data Visualization)
- folium (Interactive Mapping)
- BeautifulSoup & requests (Web Scraping for additional data)

Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Wrangling:
- Handling missing values (using median/mean imputation for specific regions).
- Standardizing city and country names.
- Removing duplicates and optimizing data types for performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed analysis of living costs vs. salaries across different countries.

Interactive Visualization: An advanced interactive map highlighting key city metrics.

Data Science in Action: Application of statistical methods or models to rank cities based on user preferences.
